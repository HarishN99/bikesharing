# bikesharing

## Overview: 
### Purpose
This project was intended to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is in fact a solid business proposal by providing a bike trip analysis. Pandas was utilized to modify the data such that it will be easier to visualize in Tableau. These new visualizations will be created in hopes of solidifying our analysis to pitch to the investors. The created visualizations needed to demonstrate the following:
- The length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders.
- The number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week.
- The number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.


## Results: 
Using the visualizations you have in your Tableau Story, describe the results of each visualization underneath the image.
